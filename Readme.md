# Online Cooking Guide

## Project Overview

**Authors**: Adonis Fuentes, Elizabeth Violi, and Klara Vertes

The **Online Cooking Guide** is designed to serve as an educational resource that complements or replaces traditional home economics courses. With cooking being an essential life skill, this website aims to bridge the gap for students and parents who lack access to such classes. It provides a wide array of tasty recipes that consider various dietary restrictions, making it inclusive and accessible for all users.

Additionally, the website features illustrated, step-by-step guides that simplify the cooking process for beginners while promoting broader understanding and accessibility.
