# Welcome to Our Cooking Guide, Kittla

We created this guide as a way for young adults to be introduced to cooking in a fun, interactive, and non-judgmental manner. Not long ago, we were young individuals with an affinity for UberEats and dining out, mostly because the stress of not knowing how to cook became too debilitating to even get to step one. This website is a documentation of our journey to become the at-home chefs we wish to be, and we hope that others join us in this experiment and realize their full culinary potential as well.

## Our Goal

The **Online Cooking Guide** is designed to serve as an educational resource that complements or replaces traditional home economics courses. With cooking being an essential life skill, this website aims to bridge the gap for students and parents who lack access to such classes. It provides a wide array of tasty recipes that consider various dietary restrictions, making it inclusive and accessible for all users.

We decided the easiest way to sort our recipes for the chef-in-training was to split them up by season, and found 12 recipes that are easy to follow and so delicious! We take into account what is in season as a way to introduce new cooks to the notion that they should cook according to the growing season. Our hope is that this website will be used as a tool by aspiring cooks to make the idea of making food less daunting.

Additionally, the website features illustrated, step-by-step guides that simplify the cooking process for beginners while promoting broader understanding and accessibility.
