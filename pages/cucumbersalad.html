            1. Prepare the cucumbers. Slice the cucumbers into 1/2-inch thick pieces. In a large mixing bowl, add the cucumbers and salt and mix until combined. Let the cucumbers sit for 20 minutes to draw out excess water. Rinse excess salt and strain out any excess water. Set aside.
            <br>
            2. Mix the dressing. In a small mixing bowl, add the grated garlic, soy sauce rice vinegar, mirin, sugar, sesame oil, and chili oil. Mix until the sugar has dissolved.
            <br>
            3. Assemble. Pat the cucumbers dry with a paper towel. Then in a large mixing bowl, add the cucumbers and dressing. Mix until combined. For the best flavor, chill in the refrigerator for 10-20 minutes before serving.
            <br>
            4. Serve. Serve the Din Tai Fung cucumbers garnished with chopped Fresno chili.
