              Zucchini Gratin - This gratin is great for dinner parties and doled out as a side for guests to enjoy all of its cheesy goodness. Make it on  a day where you can stomach something a little bit heavier, as it requires an empty stomach to finish off this giant vegetable dish.
    <br></br>
              1. Preheat the oven to 180C Fan. Set out an oven-proof serving dish - I use a 25.5cm (10-inch) pie dish but you could use a roasting tin or any other similar-sized dish with high-ish sides.
                  <br></br>
              2. Make the tomato sauce: heat the olive oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the cherry tomatoes, season well and cook for 3 minutes or until the tomatoes start to burst. Using the back of a wooden spoon,
                  <br></br>
              break them down to form a sauce. Add the sliced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds, stirring occasionally.
              3. Tip into your serving dish and sprinkle with the sliced basil. Set aside.
                  <br></br>
              4. Using a mandoline, thinly slice the courgettes. Tip into a large mixing bowl and drizzle generously with olive oil, then season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Sprinkle in the freshly plucked thyme leaves from the sprigs. Use your hands to coat the slices with the oil and seasoning.
                  <br></br>
              5. Using a sharp knife, thinly slice the tomatoes, place into a bowl and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
                  <br></br>
              6. To assemble, carefully arrange 2 rows of courgette slices. Spread some of the Garlic and Herb Boursin onto the tomato slices before adding a neat row next to the courgette. Repeat, alternating between 2 rows of courgette, followed by 1 row of Garlic and Herb Boursin-spread tomato, until you have filled your dish.
                  <br></br>
              7. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Bake for about 35 minutes or until softened and golden.
                  <br></br>
              8. Meanwhile, make the whipped Boursin: place the Boursin and double cream into a food processor and blitz for about 1 minute - or until smooth and creamy. Spoon into a bowl.
                  <br></br>
              9. Once the gratin is cooked, remove from the oven and garnish with a few dollops of the whipped boursin, some fresh basil leaves and a drizzle of fresh pesto.
                  <br></br>
              LO. Serve with hot crusty bread, the remaining whipped boursin and a fresh green salad. Enjoy!
